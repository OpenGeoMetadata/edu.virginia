    "dc_description_s": "Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps are highly detailed city plans providing
     researchers with a wealth of information about urban change in American cities during the first
     half of the twentieth century. These maps were originally produced for the purpose of assessing
     risk of fire and cost of insurance. The highly detailed plans were drawn at a scale of 50
     feet/inch, printed in color, and record detailed information about such features as streets,
     railroads, residences, businesses, factories, utilities, pipelines, wells, and dumps. Detailed
     information on individual buildings varies from simple outlines to complete floor plans,
     building heights, window and door placement, construction materials, owners, and use to which
     the building (or even room within some factories and commercial buildings). Other kinds of
     information on the maps include street names, propery parcel boundaries, house and/or block
     numbers, roof type, proximity to fire stations, and population size. *//* The UVA Library holds
     a pair of original map books for the City of Charlottesville, for 1907 and 1920, that have been
     digitized and georeferenced, which are the source material for this digital collection. *//*
     Map 01 is the INDEX map for the series. For color and black-and-white keys (legends) to these
     maps, see the the OnLine Resources below. For additional download options, again see the the
     OnLine Resources below. *//* The University of Virginia Library also holds a complete microfilm
     collection of all Virginia cities and towns that were mapped by the Sanborn Map Company from
     1885-1970. Additionally, UVA affiliated researchers can also access black and white maps
     covering the entire U.S. through the UMI website (http://sanborn.umi.com/). You must be a UVA
     affiliated researcher or student and be located on grounds or have a UVa proxy account to
     access the UMI data. For help with UMI, see our help page in the OnLine Resources
