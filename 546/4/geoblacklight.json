These maps were originally produced for the purpose of assessing\n     risk of fire and cost of insurance. The highly detailed plans were drawn at a scale of 50\n     feet/inch, printed in color, and record detailed information about such features as streets,\n     railroads, residences, businesses, factories, utilities, pipelines, wells, and dumps. Detailed\n     information on individual buildings varies from simple outlines to complete floor plans,\n     building heights, window and door placement, construction materials, owners, and use to which\n     the building (or even room within some factories and commercial buildings). Other kinds of\n     information on the maps include street names, propery parcel boundaries, house and/or block\n     numbers, roof type, proximity to fire stations, and population size. *//* The UVA Library holds\n     a pair of original map books for the City of Charlottesville, for 1907 and 1920, that have been\n     digitized and georeferenced, which are the source material for this digital collection. *//*\n     Map 01 is the INDEX map for the series. For color and black-and-white keys (legends) to these\n     maps, see the the OnLine Resources below. For additional download options, again see the the\n     OnLine Resources below. *//* The University of Virginia Library also holds a complete microfilm\n     collection of all Virginia cities and towns that were mapped by the Sanborn Map Company from\n     1885-1970. Additionally, UVA affiliated researchers can also access black and white maps\n     covering the entire U.S. through the UMI website (http://sanborn.umi.com/). You must be a UVA\n     affiliated researcher or student and be located on grounds or have a UVa proxy account to\n     access the UMI data.
