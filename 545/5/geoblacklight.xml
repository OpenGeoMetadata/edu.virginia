    <field name="dc_title_s">Web Coverage Service: Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps - Charlottesville, VA - 1920</field>
    <field name="dc_description_s">Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps are highly detailed city plans providing 
researchers with a wealth of information about urban change in 
American cities during the first half of the twentieth century.

These maps were originally produced for the purpose of assessing 
risk of fire and cost of insurance. The highly detailed plans were 
drawn at a scale of 50 feet/inch, printed in color, and record 
detailed information about such features as streets, railroads, 
residences, businesses, factories, utilities, pipelines, wells, 
and dumps.

Detailed information on individual buildings varies from simple 
outlines to complete floor plans, building heights, window and door 
placement, construction materials, owners, and use to which the 
building (or even room within some factories and commercial buildings). 

Other kinds of information on the maps include street names, 
propery parcel boundaries, house and/or block numbers, roof type, 
proximity to fire stations, and population size.

Charlottesville, for 1907 and 1920, that have been digitized and 
georeferenced, which are the source material for this digital collection.

The University of Virginia Library also holds a complete microfilm 
collection of all Virginia cities and towns that were mapped by the 
Sanborn Map Company from 1885-1970.  Additionally, UVA affiliated 
researchers can also access black and white maps covering the entire 
U.S. through the UMI website (http://sanborn.umi.com/). You must be 
a UVA affiliated researcher or student and be located on grounds or 
have a UVa proxy account to access the UMI data.  For help with UMI,
