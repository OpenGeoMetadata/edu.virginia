    <field name="dc_title_s">LNH: Mountain Lake Biological Station Datasets (Datastack)</field>
    <field name="dc_description_s">This collection (stacked series) of datasets is provided to the UVA Library's Scholars' Lab by the 
University of Virginia's Mountain Lake Biological Station, and is provided AS-IS with no guarantees as regards to its 
accuracy or temporal currency. It pertains primarily to the infrastructure, land cover and land use, and natural physical features 
of MLBS and the surrounding region, for use in assisting on-going scientific research and education at MLBS. * // * 

The TEMPORAL EXTENT of the datasets in the datastack depend upon their source: MLBS-created (2000-2007), USFS (1997), 
USCB (1995), USGS (variable), CAD survey data (1991), VAGAP (1999), Landsat (?), SPOT (?),
but some datasets may include attribute data from earlier periods. * // *

For datasets derived from DEM data (elevation, slope, aspect, hillshading, derived hydrology and watershed basins, etc) 
there are often two versions of the data; one covering a 6-quadrangle study area centered on MLBS, the other an extended 
15-quadrangle area.  Some of the other datasets derive from USFS-provided data (either from GWJ NF or from the JNF-Blacksburg 
Ranger district), others from US Census TIGER 1995 data, others were created by MLBS researchers from survey data they 
collected at MLBS. In the case of thematically-duplicated-but-not-identical datasets from different sources,  a single 
thematic description is provided (here in the abstract); see individual file listings for more info. *//*

HISTORY (Lineage):

MLBS Trail locations are based on raw GPS data collected by Eric Nagy. * 

The GWJ National Forest themes were derived from Arc/Info coverages produced at 1:24000 scale by Blacksburg Ranger District.  
Similar data sets were not available for the adjacent Monongahelia National Forest in West Virginia.  GWJNF Datasets were 
acquired from the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest GIS Database at http://svinet2.fs.fed.us/gwjnf/ftp. GWJNF 
data was subsequently clipped with the study area extent and converted to shapefiles. * 

The US Census county boundary, rivers and creeks, and roads coverages were derived from shapefile format 1:100,000 U.S. 
Census Bureau TIGER/Line95 county data referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) in decimal degrees of 
latitude/longitude and converted to NAD 27 UTM zone 17 N meters.  Data was then clipped with the county boundary. * 

Fifteen (or six) 1:24000 USGS quadrangle Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were needed to cover Giles County 
(or the more limited study area).  
DEMS were acquired in Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) format from the U.S. Geological Survey website at
http://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/DEM/7.5min .  The SDTS files were expanded using WinZip32 and converted
to DEM format with the stds2dem utility. The DEM files were imported into TNTmips and combined into a
single raster with the TNTmips Mosaic process and the bilinear interpolation method of resampling. Missing data
in the mosaicked raster were corrected using an SML script that identified "empty" cells and replaced their values
with an unweighted average of the eight-cell neighborhood.  A depressionless elevation raster was created from
the corrected mosaic using the TNTmips Watershed process, then exported as an 8-bit unsigned raster in
ERDAS format. The ERDAS file was then converted to Arc/Info GRID format. * 

The various slope, aspect, hillshaing, and watershed datasets were derived in a series of steps from the depressionless 
elevation raster in Arc/Info GRID using topographic and hydrologic tools.  The basins, watersheds, and streamnet grids were 
subsequently converted to polygon coverages and then to shapefiles. * 

The landcover map was completed by the Virginia Gap Analysis Project (VAGAP) and was obtained
from the digital library at the Virginia Tech Fish and Wildlife Information Exchange (VT-FWIE).  The landcover raster was 
converted to Arc/Info GRID format and then clipped with the county boundary polygon. * 

The 30m resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) six-band composite image was obtained from VT-FWIE.  The ERDAS format file was 
imported into TNTmips and all six bands were clipped with the study area boundary polygon using the TNTmips Extract-by-Vector 
process.  The clipped six-band composite image was exported back into ERDAS format. * 

Two SPOT scenes were needed to cover the MLBS study area.  The 10m resolution SPOT Panchromatic (PN) single-band images 
were obtained from VT-FWIE. The ERDAS format files were imported into TNTmips and clipped with the study area boundary 
polygon using the TNTmips Extract-by-Vector process.  The clipped images were combined with the TNTmips Mosaic process 
and the cubic convolution method of resampling.  The single-band mosaicked image was exported back into ERDAS format.</field>
